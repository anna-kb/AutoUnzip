# Auto Unzip

A tool to alleviate the pain of having to extract .zip and .rar files and place them in a folder. Ideal for modders that don't want to bother with a mod manager.

# WIP

 This is a work in progress and contains bugs and missing features. :bug:

To Do:
<ul>
  <li>Add a check if an extracted file already exists in the destination folder</li>
  <li>Handle that situation by setting some new syntax to the command line arguments</li>
  <li>Create a unit test</li>
</ul>
